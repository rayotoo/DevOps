### Create stack from CLI MacOS.
1. First make sure your AWS CLI is configured. Enter "key' and "Secret Key" to connect to your AWS account.
2. Use a very basic script (Yaml) to test if you are able to deploy resources using your CLI and account. Once that is working,
script can then be developed further.
4. cd to directory containing your "Yaml" file which will do the deployment and use the code below to deploy the code, where "temp-1.yml" 
is the name of the yml file. 
```
aws cloudformation create-stack  --stack-name myFirstTest --region us-east-1 --template-body file://temp-1.yml 
```

### Delete stack 
```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name myFirstTest --region us-east-1
```

```

 ### create servers stack (NB: stack-name could be whatever you choose to call it)
```
aws cloudformation create-stack  --stack-name servers --region us-east-1 --template-body file://servers.yml --capabilities "CAPABILITY_IAM" "CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM" 
```


### Delete the server stack
```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name servers --region us-east-1
```
